> Having both Khésis and Left/Right on a collaboration is a match made in heaven. These prolific producers merge their eclectic soundscapes exquisitely on 'Could Be', completely showing off their technical talent. Brimming with a dark, emotive soundscape, it's testament to the creative and experimental side of bass music. 


### Taim - Signs (feat. LØ) (Khésis Remix)

> The most infectious melody we've heard in bass music for a long time.

##### DJ Mag
> Khesis has been one of my very favourite producers over the last year or so. His tasteful and uncompromisingly original compositions constantly blow my mind. His latest trip to audiophile heaven comes in the form of a remix of one of the scene's dopest freshmen, Taim, with the glowing vocals of LØ. Treading a line somewhere between bashment, breaks and future bass, this record brings wave after wave of scintillating tones that are fine-tuned to shut down your party.

### Khésis - Graphene EP
##### Mixmag
[<img src="{% link /assets/images/press/mixmag_dec.jpg %}" />]({% link /assets/images/press/mixmag_dec.jpg %})
> From Hungary's finest bass music export Khésis comes this laid back, ethereal roller. Offering a complex juxtaposition of digital and organic percussion, the delicate atmosphere is wonderfully complemented by its raw, saturated bassline and wrapped together with the fine vocal topline.

##### DJ Mag
> You really can’t fuck with Khesis right now. He’s locked into a vibe in the studio, producing what I feel is some of the very best music the scene has experienced in years. 'Graphene' is a beautifully crafted, deep two-step jam with trancey synth lines and shiver inducing vocal snatches. Love it.

#### Volkova Sisters - TTL (Khésis & Bergi Remix)

#### Khésis - Veil
##### Mixmag
> Khésis’ debut on BRØKEN made an instant impact as soon as it hit our inbox. It slowly unwinds with vibrant, industrial synths that creep in over bass-infused beats and seductive vocal chops. It’s by no means a typical fiery breaks track, but instead a progressive, mid-set game changer that really strikes a chord. We weren’t familiar with Khésis until now, but we’ll definitely be keeping a close eye on future endeavours.
