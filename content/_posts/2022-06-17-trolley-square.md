title: "Kh√©sis & Alex Burkat - Trolley Square"
---

We made a tune with Philly based Alex Burkat, and it's now out on Rvdioactive's excellent compilation.

Alex and I first connected through Martyn's mentoring program more than a year ago having mutual respect for each other's music. We kept sending bits back and forth, and two tracks materialised. The first is Trolley Square. The second is also in the pipeline to be released!
