I recently realised that most of the mixes that I made for various outlets are pretty dated, and don't really represent the music I'm making and am into recently.
A friend recently showed me a bunch of tracks that I copied over to his USB around 3 years ago and I was horrified when I heard them.
Of course I did a couple other bits since then, but my released tracks have been few and far between, and I need to keep my DJing chops oiled, so here it goes.
